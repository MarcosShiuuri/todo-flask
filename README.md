To-do app using Python Flask.

With this app a user can create a new task and update or delete an existing one, following the CRUD principles.
The tasks created are placed in a table with the options to update or read, using SQLAlchemy as a database.

The goal of this project was to improve my knowledge of creating webapps using Flask, so the it uses basic HTML and CSS since the frontend was not the focus.
The database used was SQLAlchemy, because it was faster and easier to implement for this simple project.

VERSION OF WHAT WAS USED:

	Python - v3.11.0
	Flask - v2.2.2
	SQLAlchemy - v1.4.42
	HTML5 & CSS3
